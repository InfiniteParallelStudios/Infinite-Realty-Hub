# 🚀 URGENT: Apply Database Schema Manually

## 📋 The database schema needs to be applied manually to enable full functionality.

### **Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor**
1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fncqxcmkylscjjbcxriu/sql
2. **Log in** with your Supabase account
3. **Click** "New Query" or use the main SQL editor

### **Step 2: Copy Schema Content**
1. **Open the file**: `/Users/joshua/Desktop/DevelopementEnv/infinite-realty-hub/packages/database/src/schema.sql`
2. **Select All** (Cmd+A or Ctrl+A) 
3. **Copy** the entire content (Cmd+C or Ctrl+C)

### **Step 3: Apply Schema**
1. **Paste** the content into the Supabase SQL editor
2. **Click "Run"** to execute the schema
3. **Wait** for completion (may take 30-60 seconds)

### **Step 4: Verify Success**
After running, you should see these tables in your Supabase dashboard:
- ✅ `organizations` (multi-tenancy)
- ✅ `profiles` (user profiles)
- ✅ `module_subscriptions` (billing)
- ✅ `contacts` (CRM core)
- ✅ `communications` (contact history)  
- ✅ `leads` (sales pipeline)
- ✅ `appointments` (calendar)
- ✅ `tasks` (task management)
- ✅ `widget_configs` (dashboard)
- ✅ `notifications` (alerts)
- ✅ `audit_logs` (tracking)

## 🔍 Current Status
- ✅ Supabase connection working
- ❌ **Schema partially applied** (missing key tables)
- ❌ **Contact management not working** (foreign key errors)
- ❌ **Lead pipeline not working** (tables missing)

## ⚡ After Schema Application

Once the schema is applied, run this to test:
\`\`\`bash
node scripts/test-database-integration.js
\`\`\`

## 🎯 Why This Is Needed

The contact management system is currently configured to use the database but several tables are missing:
- `communications` - for contact history
- `leads` - for sales pipeline 
- `module_subscriptions` - for billing
- `appointments` - for calendar
- `widget_configs` - for dashboard
- `notifications` - for alerts
- `audit_logs` - for tracking

**Without these tables, the app will show errors when users try to:**
- View contact details
- Manage leads in the pipeline
- Schedule appointments
- Receive notifications

## 🚨 This is the final step to make the app fully functional!

After the schema is applied, all UI components will connect to real database operations instead of mock data.
